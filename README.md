# My Quiz App Project (finished)

This is my project of quiz app in React. Enjoy.

Ive been working like 3 days on that. Finally basic functionality is working. Right now i think how to change CSS.

Basically this is a quiz app:
- Questions can be timed or not
- You can tell how much time should be each question
- You can enable/disable answer shuffling
- You can enable/disable showing score during quiz
- You can enable/disable showing correct answer during quiz

Most challenging part was creating both timer (that can be disabled or enabled) and this thing, that stops the timer,
blocks the timer (if its enabled) shows selected answer in orange, waits a little and then either shows next question
or - if enabled - shows red/green and then shows next question.

Anyway, this is working prototype. I will start adding CSS styles to it soon.

EDIT from future: The project is finished. Maybe I will have some idea and add it to it, but right now it is finished,
working as I wanted, good looking (CSS).
